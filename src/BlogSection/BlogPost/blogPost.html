                Eating healthy is one of the hardest thing I have face since the start of my college life.
                However, the result from those hardship will improve not only your health but also your daily routine or
                work.
                <p class="textBodyHighlighted">
                    In this blog, I will share with you the tip and trick that I used in my eating habbits to improve my
                    overall health.

                <h1 class="textHeadline">1. Good time management</h1>
                <p class="textBody">- Eating healthy is hard, but the harder thing is to maintain it every single day. For that reason,
                    you cannot always take an hour or two every meal to prepare the food. Especially when you are a
                    college student, time is essential, therefore, consuming a lot of time in making a meal is
                    impractical. <br />
                    - A good way to fix this is to plan out the meal and prepare the ingredients beforehand for a week.
                    This should take place after you finished buying a week worth of food from the groceries. Every meal
                    should take at most 20 to 30 minutes.

            <span>
                <h1 class="textHeadline">2. Manage your Nutrients intake</h1>
                <p class="textBody">- When it is about healthy eating, it is not only about eating food that is considered healthy. It
                    should be that you provide your body with enough required nutrition while avoiding over taking the
                    bad ones like fat or carbs.<br />
                    - For Carbohydrates, you can take it in by consuming food that has a combination of carbs and
                    fibers, which helps fulfil your hunger and avoid over taking carbs.<br />
                    - You should quit any fast food or deep fried food to avoid over taking fat content from the food.
                    Try replace cooking oil with olive oil since it provides more health benefits.

                <h1 class="textHeadline">3. Meal diversity </h1>
                <p class="textBody">- Having vast amount of meals to cook is crucial in maintaining a healthy life. Since eating chicken
                    breast every meal for seven days a week can potentially break your mentality, you should put in your
                    pocket several recipes to prevent you feeling eating healthy is boring.<br />
                    - However, sometimes it feels like a pain if you try to replace every dish in every meal. For me, I
                    usually keep my simple vegetable dish with bok choy stir fry with garlic, soy sauce, and olive oil
                    in every most of the meals.

                <h1 class="textHeadline">4. Final words</h1>
                <p class="textBody">
                    Eating healthy is not an asignment that we can simply complete over a day, it is a life style that
                    needs discipline and hardwork. With these tips that I have been using through out my college years,
                    I believe it can help you achieve a productive and healthy life in no time.
